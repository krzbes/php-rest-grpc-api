# Master‚Äôs Thesis: gRPC & REST Testing Project

Welcome to the repository for my **Master‚Äôs Thesis Project**, the goal is to compare **gRPC** and **REST** services in **PHP**.

---

## üìñ Overview

This project presents a dual-protocol API, enabling seamless communication via both gRPC and REST. It was developed as part of my graduate research work to explore performance, reliability, and security aspects of modern service architectures.

---

## üåü Key Features

- **Dual Protocol Support**: Test suites for both gRPC and REST endpoints
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Clear separation of business logic through well-defined bounded contexts
- **Doctrine ORM**: Database interactions managed via Doctrine for flexibility and portability
- **Buf(gRPC Tooling)**: Protobuf schemas in `/schema` and autogenerated PHP code in `/gen/Schema` via Buf for contract compliance
- **RoadRunner**: Configured via `.rr.yaml` for a high-performance PHP application server
- **Symfony Security Core**: Robust authentication & authorization mechanisms for secure API access
- **Containerized Setup**: Docker Compose (`docker-compose.yaml`) orchestrates database services
- **Environment Management**: Configurable via `.env.example` for environment variable setup

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies

- PHP 8.x
- Symfony Framework
- Doctrine ORM
- RoadRunner
- Buf (gRPC tooling)
- PHPUnit & Pest for testing
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krzbes/php-rest-grpc-api.git
   cd php-rest-grpc-api
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Configure environment**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust database and gRPC endpoint settings

Thank you for checking out my thesis project!
